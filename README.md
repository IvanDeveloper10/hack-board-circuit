## HEARTH BOARD
This project is a PCB with a theme of heart, a design perfect and the circuit fine.

This project uses passive components, has an excellent LED layout, and is a gift for a colleague. I created the heart shape using the line drawing tool on the PCB cutouts.

I used a capacitor, a potentiometer, a push button, 11 LEDs and also a battery cell as a power source.
