## 10/7/2025 - Creating the schema

I am creating the schematic for the development board, I am using the KiCad software and also the blueprint guide. I added the RP2040, the capacitors, the crystal, the USB port, made the resistor connections, labeled them, and also added the component to regulate the voltage.  

## 10/13/2025 - Working in the schema  

I've been working hard on the blueprint guide. I haven't had a chance to upload any development history lately. The last thing I did was add pins, label, adjust, and reposition.

Once the layout is complete, the next step is to work on the PCB routing and organization.
